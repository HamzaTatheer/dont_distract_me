# Dont Distract Me

After 2 hours of procastination, I finally opened my laptop. I opened youtube to search for something related to my work but there was a really interesting video that I had to watch. I couldnt resist looking at just one video and then continuing the cycle of watching more and more videos and hence wasting my time.This extension serves the purpose of keeping someone less distracted.
